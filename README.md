## API Documentation

The documentation for the TeamGif API can be found [here.] 

## Key Features
##### Users
  - 
##### Authentication
  - TeamGif uses JWT for authentication.
  - On successfull sign up or sign in, the user receives a token in the `OAuth` header which can be used to authenticate requests to protected endpoints.
  For a list of endpoints that are protected and those that are not, see our [documentation]

##### Real time updates
  - The client side implementation uses React, which helps ensure that the app updates in real time. You can interact with the hosted app [here.]

##### Password recovery
  - Forgot your password? No problem. Users can request a password reset, and get a mail with reset instructions.

## Technology Stack

TeamGif uses the PERN (PostgreSql, Express, ReactJs, NodeJs) stack.

#### Client Side: 
  - Front-end implementation in REACT
  - Styling with CSS
  

#### Server Side:
  - Server-side implementation is built on NODE, with an
      EXPRESS server and POSTGRES DB.

#### Authentication and Code Base Organization
  - Written in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
  - BABEL transpiler 
  - Json Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.  
    
#### Code Quality
